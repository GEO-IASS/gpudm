Estimation of skin optical properties from hyperspectral images using an inverse diffusion model and CUDA. 

This source code will become available when our paper, A. Bjorgan, L. L. Randeberg, "Implementation of a real-time algorithm for estimating spatially resolved optical properties from hyperspectral images" (in submission) is published.
